    <h1>Foods</h1>
    <p>
        Food is any substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.
        Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.

    <h1>Traditional foods of India</h1>
    <p>
        A foodie’s paradise, India is filled with many opportunities to taste local delicacies and tantalise the taste buds.

        With so many dishes having been exported though, it’s sometimes difficult to distinguish between authentic dishes and watered-down versions.
        
        To help you navigate India’s epic food scene, we’ve put together this list of 10 traditional must-try foods to eat in India.
    </p>
    <p> 1) Masala dosa
        Arguably South India’s most renowned culinary export, masala dosas are famous the world over. A sort of Indian pancake, dosas are made from a thin batter consisting of rice, flour and lentils. Making dosas is no easy task, with the batter mixture having to soak in water for at least 24 hours before it can be shaped. Once ready, the batter is ladled onto a hot tava (griddle pan) and shaped in a similar way to how the French would shape a crepe. Traditionally, dosas are served folded in half and stuffed with potatoes. Accompaniments like hot sambar give the dish a spicy edge, and whatever you stuff them with, dosas are sure to provide a tasty yet satisfying meal.

        2) Barfi:
        We’ve cheated a little bit here, as the term barfi can be used to describe any number of Indian sweets. The most traditional type though is milk barfi. Predictably, these milk-based sweets are made from milk powder, condensed milk, ghee and cardamom powder. Barfi is not going to help anyone reach their health-conscious goals, but these indulgent fragrant desserts are sure to bring a smile to the face of anyone who tries them. These sweets are traditionally gifted as good luck offerings at occasions like wedding ceremonies, but there’s nothing to say you can’t pop down to the sweet shop to buy one to accompany your afternoon chai.

        3) Pani puri:
        Pani puri, or gol guppa,  are thought to originate from the northern state of Bihar. A perfect streetside snack, pani puri are hollow deep fried balls made of semolina or wheat. They’re served alongside spicy potatoes, chickpeas and a spicy tamarind water. Eating pani puri is an experience in itself, as you traditionally crack open the top of the deep fried shell with a spoon before filling it with the delicious accompaniments. Most Indians eat each pani puri with one swift bite, to save any of the filling spilling out of the delicate case. This infamous street snack unites most of the country – everyone from local college students to city businessmen can be found devouring them.gol-gappa-indian-street-food

        4) Idli:
        Popular across South India, idli are often thought of as the breakfast versions of dosa. Eaten at the start of the day, idli are a type of light savoury rice cake. Made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils and rice, these rice cakes are dangerously easy to eat. Since idli are pretty bland on their own, these mini pancake-like breakfast staples are served alongside sambar, coconut based chutneys, or spicy fish curries. Over the years, idli has evolved into many different varieties, so you’re sure to find one that satisfies your taste buds.
